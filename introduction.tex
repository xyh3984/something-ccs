\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
This is a sample!  It does not have a lot of fancy stuff in it, but if
you want to see a more complex sample, look at the original ACM
templates.

To fill up enough text to fill up 3 pages, we've included the CCS Call
for Papers three times.  It is always a good idea to include some
gratuitious citations to recent CCS papers~\cite{medvinsky1993netcash,
  bellare1993random, anderson1993cryptosystems, blaze1993cryptographic}.
